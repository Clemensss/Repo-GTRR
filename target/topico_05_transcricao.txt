05 – Scientific Socialism
so, by now we've got a basic, and I mean really basic, analysis
of the way capitalism works, then what?
we've seen that capitalism explores and throws us in poverty.
so, what do we do with this? 
very well, capitalism has developed our productive forces at a novel way .
it brought an unprecedented level of productivity, unknown to humanity by then.
however, at the same time, it thrown a huge part of humanity into misery,
A huge chunk of people was proletarianized, lost everything they had,
and turned to selling their work force for /in exchange of the bare minimum to survive
while bearing strenuous work hours.
so, how did we sharply increase productivity and poverty as the same time?
how did we enlarge machinery and automation levels and work load simultaneously? 
why is it that there's more and more automation and work load never decreases?
those are the contradictions that will be our target in this next analysis.
okay, next: "Analyzing Capitalism",
we've come to the conclusion that capitalism is based in exploration, right?
this being, the first thing we can know for a fact is:
there are no exploiter without exploited, this has always been the case, right?
guys, there where always exploiters and the exploited?
Lets dig into that.
we know, also, that the mechanism of exploitation comes through private property.
Marx, through the method (dialectical and historical materialism),
come to the reasoning that there has not always been private property.
and not just that, he also found that there has been different kinds of private property throughout history .
the same goes to social classes, those weren't always in the scene,
throughout history, social classes are quite a lot different.
what can we take out of this observations of Marx?
it's that the existence of social classes and private property
it's linked to a certain phase of the development of production.
Whats so relevant about that?
Essa conclusão do Marx faz com que a gente consiga enxergar
que essas organizações sociais, essas organizações humanas, não são indispensáveis.
Private property isn't necessary for human society.
Social classes aren't imperative for human society.
So, the notion that there will always be employers and employees is false..
Não só isso; através da análise material do capitalismo,
o Marx chega à conclusão de que a gente já tem recursos para marchar em direção a outra sociedade,
com outras relações sociais.
Então, vamos lá, uma citaçãozinha aqui do Marx para a gente debater,
uma citação do Manifesto Comunista:
“Uma epidemia, que em qualquer outra época teria parecido um paradoxo,
desaba sobre a sociedade - a epidemia da superprodução.
...The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.”
what is that Marx mean here?
By the first time in history, human society was dealing with the inverse of the it's usual problem.
until then, society had only dealt with the lack of production issue.
society had an scarcity trouble.
the capitalist mode of production brought a new problem: excess of production.
the catch is: there's only excess of production on capitalism
for the capitalist means of production are illogic, are irrational.
capitalism does not produce in order to satisfy our needs, it does to sate the needs of the capital.
If production doesn't become capital it is discarded.
That is to say/meaning, the capitalist means of production jeopardize our productive capability.
we're hindered from producing more and better due to capitalism.
So according to Marx, the capitalistic ways are obsolete. OBSOLETE.
They need to be transformed.
Is such transformation possible? Not only possible. according to Marx, it's very likely. Why?
Throughout capitalism's development, it creates its own contradictions
which will be what brings its downfall, unavoidably.
By expanding, capitalism generate proletariats 
proletariat by proletariat, more ,more and more 
This class that it creates, is the one which antagonizes it..
Marxism's greatest asset was to perceive that there are not only the classes,
and that those classes are unavoidably antagonistic to each other.
They'll never reach harmony, for they have contradictory interests/goals.
To this antagonism between the two main classes of capitalistic society,,
we named class struggle. Class struggle.
For Marxism, each and every doctrine, each and every set of principles
that attempts to balance classes, harmonize classes are utopic. 
it's fallacious  It's a front.
If there is an exploited class, there will be a exploiter class above it/  the dominant class will always stand atop the dominated one. Every time.
The Utopians, which we talked about before, had no perspective of any class.
They sought a society which balanced all of humanity.
having perspective of the classes is knowing that they are antagonistic.
it is fundamental to what we call Scientific Socialism; which is how Engels name it.
This expression appeared to contrast with Utopic Socialism.
So, why does this matters?
According to Marx, class struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat
will lead to a rupture with capitalism.
Whats relevant about Marx is that not only he identifies classes
he also credits revolutionary protagonist to the exploited class.
The proletariat becomes the revolution's Subject. 
The proletariat belongs to the class that will conduct revolution, unlike the Utopians.
Utopians believed that the working class were unable to lead any change.
That any change would come from top-down.
Marx said otherwise: it would come bottom up
