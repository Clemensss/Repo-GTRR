02 - Dialectical and Historical Materialism
Well, little do people that never got into contact with communism know 
but communism appears as a critique of utopianism
and a critique of idealism. 
Marxism's philosophical pillar is constituted 
as a critique of utopianisms and idealisms 
And that's what we're going to talk about now.
We'll talk about dialectical and historical materialism 
and the name already sounds scary, right? A philosophical curse word, 
and that's why I said that I might have chosen to start by the most complicated part, but I beg you give it a chance. 
Right then, Remember Marx was a Young Hegelian? 
Well, even though he was a harsh critic of Hegel's philosophy, 
Marx was heavily influenced by Hegel. 
But influenced in what way? 
Mainly regarding a thing called dialectics. 
So, dialectical and historical materialism, we'll begin
by talking a bit about dialectics. 
So what is dialectics? 
That's something we'd need ten tomes to answer, 
but I'll try and summarize. 
First of all, Hegelian dialectics was opposed to another philosophical method called metaphysics, which was the dominant philosophical method up to Hegel.  
In order for us to understand dialectics 
it's worth it to understand what metaphysics is
because one thing makes the other clearer.  
That's the part of the stream where I'll cite the most, ok? 
I'll avoid reading too many quotations 
but I think these ones are helpful
because this part is quite difficult.  
Right then, We've said that dialectics opposes metaphysics. 
Engels: "To the metaphysician, things and their mental reflexes, ideas, are isolated, are to be considered one after the other and apart from each other, are objects of investigation fixed, rigid, given once for all. He thinks in absolutely irreconcilable antitheses. His communication is 'yea, yea; nay, nay'; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. For him, a thing either exists or does not exist; a thing cannot at the same time be itself and something else. Positive and negative absolutely exclude one another". 
That's metaphysics then.
In summary: metaphysics is a method that works with isolated,
fixed categories.
Dialectics, on the other hand, another quote from Engels: 
"...comprehends things and their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation, motion, origin and ending. Such processes as those mentioned above are, therefore, so many corroborations of its own method of procedure".
That's referring to passages of this book I'm quoting, "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific" by Engels.
Dialectics is the philosophy that works with constantly moving categories that relate to each other by means of contradictions, of contraries.
So, a famous example Hegel gives, 
the master-slave dialectic.  
In summary, the master can exist only if there is a slave. 
Master and slave aren't fixed, isolated, unchanging categories. 
The category of master only exists through the existence of the slave category. Within the contradictions between master and slave. 
These categories change throughout History 
but I wont get too much into the master-slave dialectic.  
I'm just showing you how the categories that dialectics works
are interconnected and ever changing. That's it then. 
So, according to Engels, and I think that's a good analogy. 
Metaphysics cannot see the woods for the trees. 
For him and for Marx 
dialectics was much more adequate for understanding
not only natural sciences' phenomena, but also society's.  
An example of dialectics Engels gives in this book I quoted 
is Darwin's theory of evolution. 
Darwin's theory of evolution was a huge blow to metaphysics 
because it works with transformation, 
with historical change, on the very long term.  
It made it impossible to work with fixed categories, 
categories are now changing.  
They transform, they emerge and come to pass 
as History goes on.  
That's the dialectical principle of Marx's philosophy 
which is influenced by Hegel.  
Let's go to the other part then, it was dialectical and historical materialism 
Let's talk materialism. Materialism. 
I want you to do a mental exercise now. 
Look around you, wherever you are. Look around. 
Look at everything that surrounds you. 
Look if there's a table nearby, a computer, a cellphone,
a chair, anything.  
I want you to think about this: 
who made these things? Who manufactured them? 
If there's a chair where you are, who manufactured it? 
If there's a couch, who made that couch? 
And further, who transported it there? 
If the couch has metal parts, who mined the metals? 
Whose hands extracted them from the veins of the earth? 
Now I want you to reflect 
on how little we think about that.  
How little we think about who made the objects that surround us. 
And no, it wasn't machines, it wasn't just machines. 
We are surrounded by an immense amount of human labor. 
But we don't realize it. 
We're disconnected from the human labor that surrounds us. 
What is historical materialism, especially the materialism part? Materialism is the understanding that material production
is the basis for our social structure.  
Not only do we have to think about who made what is around us  
but what surrounds us is 
the basis upon which we organize society.  
The two things are connected. 
That's materialism's great trump card.
Let's go back to Hegel for a bit. 
Marx incorporated Hegel's dialectics. 
But materialism arises from a critique of Hegel. 
A critique of what exactly? Hegel was an idealist. 
Remember I said Marxism came around as a critique to idealism?  
And this critique of idealism is 
mainly a critique of Hegel's philosophy.  
So Marx takes Hegelian dialectics but  leaves out the idealism. 
Let's use a quotation from Marx himself then: 
My dialectic method is not 
only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. 
To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, 
which, under the name of “the Idea,” he even transforms 
into an independent subject,
is the demiurgos (for those who don't know, demiurgos means deity) of the real world,  
and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of “the Idea.”  
With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world 
reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought".  
That's a quotation from Capital. 
Don't worry, I know it's complicated but I'll explain. 
For Hegel, reality is a manifestation of human ideas, 
a manifestation of human thought.  
And human thought in its turn is the manifestation of the original Idea
(with capital "i") that comes from the deity, from God.  
Hegel's philosophy has a theological outlook. 
And the Young Hegelians were also idealists. 
They believed that what prevented society's development
were the ideas in people's minds.  
There needed to be a revolution in people's thought 
and only then from reason and thought, we would transform reality.  
More than that, as capitalism developed 
there appeared philosophers that saw what was happening,
the rise of poverty, of misery,
and devised fairer, more egalitarian societies 
that would free all of humanity. 
Where? In their minds. 
According to Engels, the more detailed these societies were, the further they drifted from reality. 
These philosophers became known as Utopian socialists.  
For those who don't know, utopia is a 'non--place' 
Idealism means you create an idea in your head and try to apply it to reality. 
Materialism is the opposite of that.
Marx puts this idea upside-down. 
It's not reality that is created by our thoughts. 
But rather our ideas are an abstraction of reality. 
First we get into contact with reality
and then we formulate ideas, not the contrary.
And there is an inseparable connection between material reality,
the objects that are around us, and how we organize society. 
These two things are inseparable. 
There's no social organization without a material backing, a material substrate. 
There's no use in designing a society in our heads and trying
to apply it to reality while ignoring reality itself. 
That's materialism. That's the difference, right? 
So what is material reality? To make it clearer, 
it's not only nature, but also the way we produce 
Remember I told you to look around? 
That all produced in order to satisfy our material needs. 
We have to sit down, we make a chair. 
That's part of material reality as well. 
But not only that, our production also satisfies
our cultural and intellectual wants. 
Not only eating, clothing, housing but also what we desire
to consume as culture. 
This quote is by Marx and Engels 
"What they {the individuals} are, therefore, coincides with their production,
both with what they produce and with how they produce. 
The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production." 
What we are depends on how we produce our existence. 
What we are depends on how we eat, where we live,
what we wear, how we wear. 
It depends on that, on how we transport ourselves,
how we satisfy our needs. 
So the way we produce reality
we call it infrastructure. 
Our infrastructure is the production of food, of clothing,
of houses, etc. 
A social structure arises over this infrastructure. We call that superstructure. 
It's what is above the infrastructure. 
What is there in the superstructure? Culture, religion, morals, among other things. That is, our culture, our religion, our morals, are above. 
They are built upon a material basis. 
That is to say, for example, that our religion has
everything to do with how we produce our material reality,
how we produce our food, our houses, our clothes. 
That is all connected and we can never
loose sight of the material basis of reality. 
One thing depends on the other. 
Is this a mechanical process though? 
Does that mean that every time we produce food in the same way
the same religion will emerge? 
No, it doesn't mean that the same material basis
will always give rise to the same superstructure,
but that the superstructure is dependent on the material basis. Dependent. 
It is not mechanically determined by it, but dependent on it. 
This is really important;
once this superstructure has risen,
it impacts back on the material basis. 
So our culture, our religion, our morals can
impact on how we produce our reality. 
But it doesn't exist without that reality. 
That's a dialectical movement. 
Remember we said dialectics was important? 
In its connections, in its movement, and not in fixed categories. 
Infrastructure and superstructure aren't fixed, unchanging categories.
They are connected, they interact with each other and they move.
I know it's complicated, but give it a chance and at least
 get familiarized with this vocabulary: materialism, material basis,
 infrastructure, superstructure, dialectics, etc. 
So do you remember what was dialectical and historical materialism? 
Where does the historical part come in? 
This method is such that Marx and Engels perceive
 History through the ways people produced
 their reality in order to satisfy their needs and how that affected the social structure. 
So for Marx and Engels the first historical fact is
 the satisfaction of our needs. 
The first time a human built a tool in order to satisfy a need. Thats the first historical fact. 
From the moment we satisfy a need on, we create other needs. This is the historical process for creating new needs. 
The wheel of History keeps on turning
 as we satisfy our needs. 
So Marx and Engels look at History and ask:
how did they produce? From this production, what was the social structure? 
How does the social structure of said society relate
 to the way this society produces? 
That's historical materialism. 
For summarizing, there's a quotation that's a bit long,
 but it ties together everything I've said.  
"The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and,
 next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure;
 that in every society that has appeared in history,
 the manner in which wealth is distributed and
 society divided into classes or orders
 is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced,
 and how the products are exchanged.  
From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought,
 not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into
 eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.
 They are to be sought, not in the philosophy, but in the economics of each particular epoch." 
This means that revolutions, including the bourgeois revolutions,
 didn't happen in the way liberals themselves describe it. 
The liberals say people started demanding more freedom 
and that propelled the revolution forward. 
No. Revolutions happen when our way of producing
 and reproducing life changes. 
Every revolution has a material basis, a material substrate. 
It doesn't appear in someone's mind and is then applied into reality
because that's impossible, that goes against the laws of nature. 
And that's what we call idealism.
