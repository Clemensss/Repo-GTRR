03 – Critique of Political Economy
Marxism emerges as an opposition in a critique of idealism and utopianism, ok? 
So, pay attention in this last Engel's quote here:
"They are to be sought, not in the philosophy, but in the economics" 
That's what we are going to talk now: Critique of Economy. 
So one thing that I need you to pay attention is this:
Why I first explain through the philosofical pillar? 
The philosofical pillar give us the method. 
And Marx and Engels analyze everything from now using this method. 
Dialectical and historical materialism is always the perspective. 
This method is applied to reality to understand the reality. 
And now we move on to the Economic Pillar of Marxism. 
Remember I said that Marx was exiled in France and he met Engels there? So, Engels reads Marx's texts and he criticizes Marx's texts . He said: “Marx, there is an economic dimension missing from your analyzes” 
Then Marx closed inside a library
and he reads the writings of English economists,
especially these two in the screen: Adam Smith and David Ricardo. 
And I need to clarify now: 
Can you see that I'm using the term "Political Economy" 
Back then, "Political Economy" term was dominant
because it was clear that "Economics" and "Politics" were inseparable. 
As Burgeous Economy was becoming dominant, 
they discard the "political" to give an alleged neutrality for Economics. “No, no. Economics has nothing to do with Politics. Economics is Economics.
Economics is an exact science, we do a study of reality in a neutral way."
And for Marxists, until this day the expression used is "Political Economy", ok? Marxists doesn't disassociate economy from politics. Never.
By the way, I even put here, look. 
For those who don't know, Marx's masterpiece “Capital”, “Das Kapital”, 
it's written here: “A Critique of Political Economy”, 
“Capital". Critique of Political Economy", it's the subtitle. 
So the Marxist economy develops out
of a critique of the political economy of bourgeois economists. 
And some would say, just to make it clear for you, 
some would say there is no Marxist Economics, 
that Marxist Economics is a bourgeois economy's critique, 
but you'll see controversy about it . 
Just to let you know that this exists. 
What is the critique of Marx's Political Economy? 
It's an analysis of capitalism, basically. 
Marx lived at a time when capitalism was already dominant . 
But, what is capitalism, folks? What is capitalism? 
And I'm telling you, this Critique of Political Economy's excerpt will be where I'll immunize you with a mandatory vocabulary to understand Critique of Political Economy, ok? 
Here we are going to make a kind of glossary because it's needed, right? Truly understand; know how to describe what these terms means. 
I'm going to talk like that, with just the cam, and we'll recap later. 
Anyway, relax. 
What is capitalism? Capitalism is a mode of production, mode of production. 
What is a "mode of production"? Mode of production is the result of interactions 
between productive forces and relations of production. 
What are productive forces and relations of production? Productive forces are how humans act on nature. 
Relations of production are how humans act on each other. 
Therefore, we have an action on nature and an action on each other. The interaction between these actions results in the mode of production, right? 
Point number one: What are the capitalist productive forces? 
Capitalist productive forces are the employment of industry, machinery, 
energy matrices automation, and especially division of labor, division of labor.   
In Capitalism, out work is segmented, it is broken down into specialized small parts. 
Therefore, our capitalist productive force isn't just a machine, but it's how we divide up this work. 
What are relations of production? We talked about productive forces, now we have relations of production. 
Capitalist relations of production are based in the exploitation of Proletarian labour by the Bourgeoisie, ok? 
The foundation of the relations of production is the exploitation. 
We are going to explain about exploitation further ahead. 
First of all, that exploitation is based on a class division. 
What is Class? Class, folks, is a social division of labor. 
Are there classless societies? Yes. In classless societies 
everyone has to work, everyone benefits from the fruits of labor,  
and the labor is divided by ability or skill. 
This type of division we call it "Natural Divison". 
In class societies, there is no natural division, there is a social division. 
And what does it means? Imagine that you work on a factory . 
The factory owner isn't less skilled than you to work in the factory. 
So, why do you work at the factory and he doesn't? 
Since he has the same skills as you. 
Because he belongs to another class. 
What determines the class is which position you occupy in the producion chain. 
And under capitalism, these classes are increasingly reduced to bourgeois, 
In other words, the class that doesn't work and owns the means of production, 
and proletariat, the class that does work and owns nothing
other than your work force. 
What divides these classes is not skill, it is not ability, it is not vocation, it is social. 
Well then, another characteristic of relations of production. 
We have classes and one of them own the means of production, 
that is, these means of production are private private property. 
One of the central characteristics of capitalism is the Private Property. 
What is Private Property? There is a classical definition
of the bourgeois economists themselves: Private property is 
the free disposal of another's labor power. 
When we are talking about private property,
we are talking about private property of the means of production. 
Why did private property, and only "private property", 
became synonymous with private property of the means of production? 
Because the private property of the means of production was
the first form of private property. 
So, in the time of Marx,of Smith, of Ricardo, talk about private property was talk about private property of the means of production. 
Back to definition: Private property is
the free disposal of another's labor power. 
I give an example: remember that Mode of Production is
the interaction between productive force and relations of production? 
Did we have another Modes of Production? Yes. 
We had, for example, the feudal mode of production. 
We had, for example, the slave-owning mode of production. 
For example, in the slave-owning mode of production. 
What is private property in the slave-owning mode of production? 
The slave. Remember that private property is 
the free disposal of another's labor power? 
How does the slave owner disposes of the labor force of others? 
Owning the person. Another person's work is
freely available to the slaveholder.
 
The person is the owner's private property. 
How this works in capitalism? People are not the property of the capitalist, but the capitalist owns the means of production. 
Means of production, that is, what is necessary for the work execution is taken from the hand of workers, and the capitalists controls
the worker's productive forces through wage labor. 
Workers are forced to sell their labor power to work on the means of production that have been taken from their hands. 
And how this capitalist can take
these means of production out of the worker's hand? 
Because he owns something called "Capital". 
What is Capital? Capital can be summed up in a simple few sentences
"Capital is value that creates value"; "resources that creates resources";
"wealth that creates wealth"
Capital. Capital is money? No. But capital can be money? Yes. 
They aren't synonymous, it's that what I mean.. 
What you have in your wallet now isn't capital, ok? 
Capital is a resource that can be in form of money that is used in the acquisition of means of production . 
Factory, machine, land, energy, raw material and workforce. 
Once such means are acquired they become part of capital. 
So, factory, machine, energy, raw material are part of capital, ok?   That's why capital isn't just money. 
Therefore, in short,  capitalist relations of production are based 
on class division. One class owns the means of production and doesn't work, 
the other only owns its labor labor power and sells its labor power. 
What bring us the last characteristic of relations of production:
the Commodification of Social Relations.. 
In capitalism, the commodity is the center of social relations. 
In capitalism we don't produce our existence,
we buy our existence.. 
You don't produce your food, you buy your food. 
You don't sew your clothes, you buy your clothes. 
You don't build your house, you buy your house. 
And you sell your labor fource too,
your labor force becomes a commodity. 
But, what is a commodity?  Commodity is something that is produced
for someone else's comsuption, and to be traded on the market. 
This commodity element deserves more attention. 
Because, again, as commodity is the center of all
social relations in capitalism, it needs to be undestood. 
Before that, let's review everything. 
C'mon, vocabulary:
Mode of Production: interaction between productive forces and relations of production. 
Capistalism is a Mode of Production. 
What are Productive Forces: how humans act on nature. 
What are Relations of Production: how humans act on each other.
. 
What is Class: social division of labor (as opposed to the work natural division), 
position occupied in the productive process. 
Is class determined by how much work do you get? No. 
If you earn wages, you are a worker, ok? 
If you earn wages, you are a proletariat. 
"Ah, my salary is 100K/monthly", you are a proletariat. 
Class is determined by the social division of labor. 
Class is determined by where you are in the productive process. 
What makes it so confusing is that, nowadays, we use this terminology "Upper Class", "Middle Class",  "Lower Class". 
What determines class for Marxism is
the position you occupy in the productive process, right? So that's right. 
Private Property: free disposal of another's labor power.  
Remembering that we are talking about the private property of means of production. It's not your house, your old truck, your flip-flops. 
Means of production: what is necessary for the execution of work. 
Factory, raw material, energy. 
Capital: value that creates value, resource that creates resource, wealth that creates wealth. 
Commodity: something produced to be consumed by the other,
to be sold in the market, okay?
